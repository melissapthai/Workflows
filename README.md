Launch all the Mac apps and websites you use on a daily basis with one click.

Workflows is a Mac app that lets you create custom workflows for school, work, social, and other contexts. Save time from opening the same applications over and over again, and launch them with a single click with Workflows.

## Background
I often find myself opening the same sets of apps and websites every day. In the mornings, I'd open up my terminal, code editor, email, calendar, and task management tool. When I take a social media break, I like to open up things like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. I kinda got tired of going through the same motions all the time and wanted a way to automate all of this. ‚öôÔ∏è

I knew this problem could be solved with a Mac app, but I had never created a desktop application before. So I decided to spend an entire day going through Swift and MacOS dev tutorials to solve my workflows problem, and this is what came of it. üéâ

It's by no means fancy, but it does the job! Not too shabby for a one-day build, having never done MacOS development before.

I plan on contributing more to this project over time as I learn more bits and pieces to make the app more useful and beautiful. ‚ù§Ô∏è
